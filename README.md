# Belt Optimization Journey

I've always been fascinated by the performance of Factorio, especially their belts. One day, I decided to create my own belt code, aiming to match or exceed the performance and features of Factorio's belts. This repository documents my journey and experiences. I hope someone finds it interesting or helpful. If you're only interested in the latest updates, check out [destination_based_inserters](https://github.com/tekoppar/belt_optimizations/tree/destination_based_inserters) and take a look at [belt_segment.h](https://github.com/tekoppar/belt_optimizations/blob/destination_based_inserters/headers/belt_segment.h).
## Current Status

   - Incomplete Features: The code is still not feature-complete.
   - Lack of Documentation: Currently, the code lacks comments explaining how things work or why certain decisions were made.
